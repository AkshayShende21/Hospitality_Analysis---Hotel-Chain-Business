# Hospitality_Analysis---Hotel-Chain-Business
# Project Overview:

"My objective was clear – to leverage data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions at AtliQ Grands. I focused on analyzing several key datasets to gain a comprehensive understanding of the business dynamics:

• dim_date: Provided crucial date-specific details, such as calendar dates, week numbers, and day types (weekdays and weekends), which were essential for analyzing booking patterns over time.

• dim_hotels: Offered valuable information about each property, including IDs, names, categories, and locations, helping us understand the performance and dynamics of different hotels within the chain.

• dim_rooms: Gave insights into various room types, enabling us to analyze the popularity and profitability of different room categories.

• fact_aggregated_bookings: This core dataset contained key information on bookings, property IDs, check-in dates, room types, and capacities, which were instrumental in calculating vital metrics like booking rates and occupancy.
